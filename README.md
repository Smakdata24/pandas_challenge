Three observable trends on the data:

Trend 1: Even though male players spend less on average, they seem to make more frequent purchases.

Trend 2: Players who categorize themselves as other make up less than 2% of the demographics, they tend to spend more on average on purchases than any other gender demographic.

Trend 3: The game should consider target marketing towards the 20-24 age range as they not only make up the highest percentage of players in the game but they also bring in the highest revenue.
